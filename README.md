- Hi, I’m @gavinmorrow o/
- I’m interested in web design and Rust, and am working on a browser extension ([Orion](https://github.com/gavinmorrow/orion)) and a programming language ([qua](https://github.com/gavinmorrow/qua-lang))! I know Rust, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Python, and Swift.
- I love learning!! :]

_(btw, this is probably really out of date. I don't update this very often.)_
