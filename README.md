- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gavinmorrow
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web design and Rust, and might make a game soon. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI, Rust, all those new HTML/CSS/JS features (that were released while I was learning the previous two items), and anything else I can. (And those new WWDC23 stuff that was just released! :DDD)
