- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gavinmorrow
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web design and Rust, and am making a game ([Pollywog][pollywog])! I know Rust, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Python, and Swift.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and any new HTML/CSS/JS features, along with everything else I can.

_(btw, this is probably really out of date. I don't update this very often.)_
